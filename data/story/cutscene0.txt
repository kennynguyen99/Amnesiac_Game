Chapter 1: The Awakening  (Press 'SPACE' to continue, 'ESC' to skip)
-
"Ugh... Wh- What... Where am I?"
-
You seemingly regain consciousness, opening your eyes to the cold, damp 
confines of darkness. 
-
Your surroundings are barely visible and the air is thick and foreboding. 
-
Sounds of distant water droplets and flowing liquids echo through what sounds like
corridors of brick stone walls around you.
-
You whisper to yourself strainedly, "What is this place?"
You attempt to rise from the cold stone floor but wince in pain while doing so, 
discovering your body to be covered in bruises and scratches. 
-
As you fully get up, you realize that the memory of a struggle lingers in your mind, 
but you recall nothing more. Your mind is a blank slate. "Who am I? How did I end up here?"
-
You scan around, spotting a dim, flickering light in your peripheral. With effort, you
approach the light source to a small torch on the wall.
-
The feeble light casts long shadows that dance along the walls, and you discover that the
source of the oozing noises is lava coming out from the nearby walls.
-
This seems to be some sort of dungeon.
-
"There must be answers somewhere. Someoneâ€¦ or something must have brought me here." 
-
As you ponder these mysteries, your vision becomes more clear, 
revealing a labyrinthine network of tunnels and passages in your periphery. 
-
The ominous atmosphere weighs heavily on you. "I need to find a way out of here."
-
As the only light source, you take the torch from the wall to become a guiding beacon. 
-
Your journey into the unknown has just begun, and the air is thick with 
anticipation and uncertainty.
