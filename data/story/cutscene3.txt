Chapter 4: Echoes of Betrayal
-
As you continue to traverse the dungeon corridors, a sense of deja vu washes over you. 
-
It dawns on you. You are close to where you started when you first entered the dungeon.
-
Your thoughts immediately turn to your companion, wondering why you were left alone 
in the abyss levels of the dungeon.
-
"Wait... you are alive?" A mysterious voice beckons from the darkness.
-
You look ahead to see the source of this voice. It is your long-lost companion, Medulla. 
-
His appearance seems different...
-
You glance at the relic - the one you set out to find together - now on his head. 
-
The sight of the amulet sends a flood of traumatic memories rushing back to you, 
revealing a tragic tale of betrayal and deceit. 
-
Memories of a close friend turned adversary haunt you, as you recall the fateful moment when 
you discovered the otherworldly relic - the Arcanum Amulet.
-
You both stood on the precipice of glory, the relic gleaming with untold power, 
promising to make you all-mighty. 
-
Joy filled your heart as you held the relic after days of navigating the dark dungeons.
-
*WHACK*
-
The memories play out like a cruel tapestry. 
-
Your friend, the one you trusted, suddenly turned on you. 
-
A sharp blow to the back of your head, delivered by a blunt rock, sent you reeling into darkness.
-
Betrayal echoed through the cavern as you collapsed, consciousness slipping away, as he walked off 
with the powerful relic...
-
Looking back at your now ex-companion Medulla, he seems to have been corrupted by the dark
mystic powers of the amulet, and he does not look like he is going to let you leave.
-
"This treasure is all mine, Amydgala, I have to make sure you are gone for good this time.
No one can know that I have this power."
