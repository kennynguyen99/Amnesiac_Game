Chapter 2: Shadows of the Past
-
After the grueling chase with the bat swarm lead by the behemoth mother bat, you collapse 
on your knees, as this trauma triggers memories to come flooding back, like puzzle pieces 
falling into place. 
-
You recall exploring this cave before, and a silhouette of another figure by your side
also appears in your mind.
-
A faceless, shadowy presence.
-
The images are fragmented, like pieces of a dream you are desperately trying to grasp.
-
Suddenly, the memory sharpens. 
-
You and the figure were making your way through the cave, navigating its twists and 
turns together. 
-
But then, the behemoth bat emerged. 
-
You valiantly attempted to hold off the creature, while the other figure made a run for it. 
-
Just as you were cut off from each other, they gave a final yell of a name. 
-
"Amygdala"
-
Is that... ...your name...?
-
The recollection sends shivers down your spine. 
-
You mutter to yourself, "Who was that shadowy companion, and why were we exploring this 
perilous cave together?" 
-
The answers elude you, wrapped in the shadows of your forgotten past.
-
The air remains thick with anticipation, and the shadows of the past continue to whisper 
their secrets in the echoing tunnels of the dungeon. You continue your journey.
