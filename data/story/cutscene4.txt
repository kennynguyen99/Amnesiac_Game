Epilogue: Into the Light
-
With Medulla defeated, at last, you emerge from the dungeon into the blinding light of day,
the afterglow of your intense battle lingering in the air. 
-
The weight of mixed emotions settles within you, a blend of relief and lingering sorrow. 
-
Despite the trials and betrayals, you find solace in the fact that you have finally escaped 
the oppressive depths of the dungeon.
-
Your eyes adjust to the brilliance of daylight, and you take a moment to savour 
the warmth of the sun on your face. 
-
The horizon stretches before you, offering a vast expanse of possibilities. 
-
You inhale deeply, the air is fresh and invigorating.
-
With the dungeon now behind you, it is time to make the long journey back home, eager to 
leave the shadows of the past behind. 
-
"The path home awaits," you mutter, as you embark on your next journey.
